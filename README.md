# 🪐 Mars Exploration - Image Segmentation with Deep Learning

## 📚 University Project - Polytechnic of Milan  
This project was developed as part of a university course at the **Polytechnic of Milan** by our team. The goal was to apply **deep learning techniques** for **image segmentation** in the context of **Mars exploration**.

## 👥 Team - "Four Neurons"
We are a team of four students passionate about deep learning and computer vision. This project allowed us to apply our knowledge in **image segmentation** and fine-tuning state-of-the-art architectures.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Task:** Segment images of the Martian surface to identify different terrain types.  
- **Dataset:** grayscale images (64x128), with 5 terrain categories based on pixel annotations.  
- **Model:** Implemented **U-Net** and **DeepLabV3** architectures using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
- **Performance:** Achieved **0.58 mIoU (mean Intersection over Union)** on the test set.
